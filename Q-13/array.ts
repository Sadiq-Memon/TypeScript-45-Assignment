// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let Transport = ["Civic" , "Audi" , "Aqua"];
console.log('I Would Like to own a ' + Transport[0]);
console.log('I Would Like to own a ' + Transport[1]);
console.log('I Would Like to own a ' + Transport[2]);
